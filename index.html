Hi my name is Steven Savage and I am a 15 year old developer that makes games (I also Coded this website).<br> 
I am also a passionate gamer so you can know for sure that these games will fulfill your needs for a game.<br>
Some of my favourite games include Terraria, Call Of Duty, Apex Legends, Brawl Stars and other action games.<br>
I also like to play a lot of board games that require strategy so my games will not be as simple as they seem<br>
This website will be used to document any changes or fixes I make to my games.

<center><p>
My Current project is called On Thin Ice. On Thin Ice is a parkour rage game, inspired by Only Up and Getting Over It<br>
but my game has a unique twist, you can never stop moving and you will change directions when hitting a wall other than <br>
that you cannot turn. You can control the speed that you go with, "a" for slow speed, "s" for regular speed, and "d" for fast movement.<br>
This game requires lots of strategy, regarding when you slowdown and speed up, causing there to be some brain activity while playing.<br>
The main objective of this game is to reach the top in the shortest amount of time possible with a timer in the top right. <br>
</p></center>
<center><p>
If you want to submit a run, screenshot you at the end of the game with the timer visible. <br>
Email the screenshot and a username to <a href="mailto:savageleaderboards@gmail.com">My Email</a>

I decided that just jumping and changing speeds wasn't enough so I decided to add a wall jump system that only works in <br>
certain locations. These locations are currently marked by a darker blue block. Here is a video of the new wall jump system
